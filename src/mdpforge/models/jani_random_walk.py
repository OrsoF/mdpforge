"""Unidimensional random walk from pinned JANI sources.

Reachable valuations and locations define states; enabled choices define actions.
Missing action slots repeat the first choice; stopped states absorb at zero.
Probability objectives pay a signed unit bonus on first reaching the target;
discounting replaces unbounded probabilities and outer verification assertions.
Native rewards retain their scale; minimisation objectives are negated.
The DTMC keeps one action; its declared reward is the current position, without stopping.
Sources and parameters: _jani/_data/model_manifest.json.
